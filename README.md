# Helium
Bullshit-free web browser, based on Chromium. Follows [imput](https://github.com/imputnet)'s ethics and norms.

Very WIP, not meant for public/end user consumption, etc.

First and foremost, we're making a good browser for ourselves.
We don't intend to reinvent the wheel or target everyone, it isn't Helium's goal.
The main goal is to provide an honest, comfortable, privacy-respecting, and non-invasive experience.
If you don't like it - you don't like it, that's totally okay, and we don't care.

There's a lot more to Helium, but we don't have a complete set of features yet.
We'll update the documentation when we're closer to a public release!

## Platform-specific packaging
At the moment, we're only working on [Helium for macOS](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-macos).
We plan to create packaging for Windows & Linux systems in the future, but that's over the horizon for now.

## Credits
### ungoogled-chromium
Helium is proudly based on [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium).
It wouldn't be possible for us to get rid of Google's bloat and get a development+building pipeline this fast without it.
Huge shout-out to everyone behind this amazing project!
(and we intend to contribute even more stuff upstream in the future)

### The Chromium project
[The Chromium Project](https://www.chromium.org/) is obviously at the core of Helium,
making it possible to exist in the first place.
